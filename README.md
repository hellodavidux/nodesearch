# Add Elements UI

A Next.js project with a modern UI component library.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js) or pnpm

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, install all the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Or if you're using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Run the Development Server

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or with pnpm:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### 3. Connect to Localhost

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to:

**http://localhost:3000**

The development server will automatically reload the page when you make changes to the code.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start the development server
- `npm run build` - Build the project for production
